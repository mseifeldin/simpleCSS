    <h1>The Melted Pot Kitchen</h1>
    <p>I grew up in a bit of an odd home. My parents are immigrants from Egypt, and although I ate a lot of Egyptian food growing up, my mother also liked to experiment with food from other cultures. I've been meaning to get her recipes down and organized in one place for a while, so here they are!</p>

    <h2>Chicken Piccata</h2>

    <p>An Italian dish that was also often served in my house growing up.</p>

    <ul>

    	<li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 T olive oil</li>
        <li>8 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
        <li>2 T butter</li>
        <li>2 T dry sherry</li>
        <li>2 T fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 T capers, chopped</li>
        <li>2 T chicken stock (optional)</li>
        <li>8 thin lemon slices</li>
        <li>2 T chopped parsley</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
    	Saute onions and garlic in olive oil until tender and remove from heat. Pound chicken breasts flat. In a flat bowl, mix flour, salt and pepper. Dip chicken into this mixture. Lightly brown chicken in butter, about 2-3 minutes per side. Add sauteed onions and garlic. Turn up the heat and add sherry, lemon juice, and capers. If the sauce becomes too thick, add chicken stock. Garnish with lemon and parsley.
