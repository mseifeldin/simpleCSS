        <h1>The Melted Pot Kitchen</h1>
        <p>I grew up in a bit of an odd home. My parents are immigrants from Egypt, and although I ate a lot of Egyptian food growing up, my mother also liked to experiment with food from other cultures. I've been meaning to get her recipes down and organized in one place for a while, so here they are!</p>

        <h1>Foule</h1>

                In a slow cooker, Submerge the beans by an inch to two of water.
                Cover and turn cooker on high overnight (about 8-12 hrs).
                In the morning, check on doneness. Top layer may be black. You can mix it in  and cook longer or discard.
                If done, add salt, vinegar, lime juice.
