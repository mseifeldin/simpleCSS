        <h1>The Melted Pot Kitchen</h1>
        <p>I grew up in a bit of an odd home. My parents are immigrants from Egypt, and although I ate a lot of Egyptian food growing up, my mother also liked to experiment with food from other cultures. I've been meaning to get her recipes down and organized in one place for a while, so here they are!</p>

            <ul>

            	<li>3 cornish game hens, halved</li>
                <li>1 level teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 level teaspoon pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons onion juice</li>
                <li>1 & 1/2 oz butter</li>
                <li>1/2 pint water</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
            	Pound each cornish game hen flat with a meat mallet. Brush hens with mixture of salt, pepper, lemon and onion juices. Let stand for at least 15 minutes. Place hens in hot butter in heavy pan; cover and cook until brown, then turn hens; cover and brown other side. When brown, add water and continue cooking until hens are done. Serve with natural sauce or sauce thickened with browned flour.
