        <h1>The Melted Pot Kitchen</h1>
        <p>I grew up in a bit of an odd home. My parents are immigrants from Egypt, and although I ate a lot of Egyptian food growing up, my mother also liked to experiment with food from other cultures. I've been meaning to get her recipes down and organized in one place for a while, so here they are!</p>

        <h2>Sharkasayya</h2>
            <p>I think this was originally a Turkish dish, but my mom got this recipe from my grandmother.</p>

        <p>For the chicken:</p>

            <ul>

            	<li>1 chicken</li>
                <li>3-4 C water</li>
                <li>1 T salt</li>
                <li>1 small onion</li>
                <li>1 carrot</li>

            </ul>

        <p>for the sauce:</p>

            <ul>

                <li>3 & 3/4 C ground walnuts</li>
                <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
                <li>3-4 t minced garlic</li>
                <li>3 slices french bread</li>
                <li>1/4 t salt</li>
                <li>1/2 T paprika</li>
                <li>1 t cayenne</li>
                <li>2 C chicken stock (can take from chicken prep)</li>
                <li>3 T vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 t (Hungarian) paprika</li>
                <li>walnut halves for garnish</li>
                <li>paprika oil (optional)</li>

            </ul>

        <p> 
            Boil chicken in a pot with water, slat, onion, and carrot. Bring down to a simmer until cooked (about 45 mins). Remove skin and bones and tear into bite size pieces. Reserve stock for the sauce.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remove crusts from bread and soak in shallow water for 5 minutes. Squeeze the bread dry and set aside. In a blender or food processor, combine walnuts, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, bread, cayenne, and paprika with 2 C of the chicken stock to make a thick sauce. Mix with chicken. Serve over rice and garnish with walnut halves and paprika oil.
