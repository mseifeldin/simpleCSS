    <h1>The Melted Pot Kitchen</h1>
    <p>I grew up in a bit of an odd home. My parents are immigrants from Egypt, and although I ate a lot of Egyptian food growing up, my mother also liked to experiment with food from other cultures. I've been meaning to get her recipes down and organized in one place for a while, so here they are!</p>

    <h2>Pecan Chicken</h2>
    <p>A southern-inspired American dish. I would often ask for it on my birthday.</p>

        <li>1 cup pecans</li>
        <li>2 T cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 t dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 t paprika</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        Pulse pecans, cornstarch, thyme, paprika, salt, and cayenne in a food processor until the nuts are a chopped fine and transfer to a bowl. In another bowl, whisk together egg and water. Dip each piece of chicken in the egg mixture then in the nut mixture. Heat the oil in a large frying pan and cook the chicken about 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. In a seperate bowl mix the dipping sauce by combining the mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, sugar, parsley, and a pinch more each of cayenne and salt.
